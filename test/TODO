### PRO TIPS
    wrapper classes shall have reference to VkInstance class so it is not garbage collected
        it will also ensure that objects are cleared in correct order... hopefully ":D

### SOON


### NOW
    replace byte buffer with memory object in array ?
    replace string array with pointers ?
    replace some int types with new defined data types ?

    ad simplified create instance
    make native arrays extend pointer somehow ???

### DONE
